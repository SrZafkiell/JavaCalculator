# JavaCalculator



### Why?
The only reason for this program was to practice Java and Java docs. It was a challenge in the course that I had to take down. <br>
Hopefully, soon I'll be able to create a GUI for it. (If it is not implemented yet when you read this)


### Was it worth it?
This was completely worth it. Maybe for some advanced devs, this will look trashy, and it has no point. But for me, at the moment I coded it, it had a lot of sense, and I needed to practice in one way or another.
Maybe it won't help me now, landing a new job, but it hopefully will. This is how I started my Java journey, but it doesn't dictate how it will end.

### Advice?
At some point, I was skeptical about doing simple programs and wanted to learn harder things first. But in the end, if you don't master the basics, you won't be a good programmer.


#### Important notes to self (About the program):

- The first implementation was okay, using Interface and separated classes. 
- The new implementations (having the "perform" function inside the Enum) are more suitable for this case, where no other dev needs access to that function to add more features. 
- The program might be overloaded with trashy documentation. Once the program becomes readable, there is no need to add obvious documentation.
